# M4ATools JavaScript Port

This is a JavaScript port of the popular Swift library M4ATools ([ahyattdev/M4ATools](https://github.com/ahyattdev/M4ATools)). It runs in your browser and won't freeze the page. As of right now, it's used in [my smart TV OS](https://thewebtv.github.io/) for reading metadata from M4A files, so you can see it in action there by connecting an iPod.
